All notable changes to the MEF_ELine NApp will be documented in this file.

[UNRELEASED] - Under development
********************************

Fixed
=====
- Try to handle uni interface up as link up for inter-EVCs
- EVCs activation now take into account UNIs statuses before trying to activate
- ``EVC.remove_current_flows()`` had its parameter ``current_path`` used when ``evc.current_path`` fails to install flows.
- ``evc.current_path`` is deleted when an error with TAG type is raised.

Added
=====
- Added migration script for updating the default ``queue_id`` from ``None`` to ``-1``
- Added added paramenter support for redeployment, ``PATCH v2/evc/{evc_id}/redeploy?try_avoid_same_s_vlan=true``. By default it will try to avoid ``s_vlan`` from ``current_path`` links.
- Added option to opt out from trying to avoid previous ``s_vlan`` when redeploying EVCs.

Fixed
=======
- UI: fixed issue where non-JSON data was being parsed as JSON data.

Changed
=======
- UI: changed variable name which was the reserved keyword interface to k_interface
- UI: changed the interface variable for k_interface since it was a reserved keyword
- UI: the mef_eline modal now uses the modal component
- UI: fixed premature submit when pressing Enter during autocomplete on inputs
- UI: fixed path constraints fields to be collabsed by default when creating EVC to better usability for listing EVCs
- ``primary_path``, ``backup_path``, ``primary_links`` and ``backup_links`` now only accept endpoint IDs in the API request content.
- Now when installing or deleting a path, a single request to ``flow_manager`` will be sent per path.

[2024.1.4] - 2024-09-09
***********************

Fixed

- Fixed evc.old_path clean up


[2024.1.2] - 2024-08-26
***********************

Fixed
=====
- Flows sent through an event are deep copies, meaning these can be modified from a subscriber NApp without affecting other subscribers.
- Added exception handler when getting path for disjointed paths.

[2024.1.1] - 2024-08-23
***********************

Fixed
=====
- Fixed flow mods when deleting ``old_path``

[2024.1.0] - 2024-07-23
***********************

Added
=====
- EVC list now utilizes ``localStorage`` to store ``search_cols`` and make them persistent throughout EVC list usage.
- Added ``kytos/mef_eline.uni_active_updated`` event
- Included "id" on EVC mapped content to normalize it with the other models
- Introduced ``failover_old_path``, ``failover_deployed``, and ``failover_link_down`` events, which will be primarily consumed by ``telemetry_int`` NApp
- UI checkbox to request that In-band Network Telemetry (INT) gets enabled
- Added ``{"deployed": false}`` to request response for EVC creation. It indicates if the created EVC has been able to deployed.
- Added ``{'redeployed': false}`` to request response for ``PATCH v2/evc/{{circuit_id}}``. It indicates if the modified EVC has been redeployed.

Changed
=======
- Updated python environment installation from 3.9 to 3.11
- Optimized ``Path.status`` not to depend on a HTTP request
- Upgraded UI framework to Vue3 
- ``enable`` is not longer accepted when patching/updating an EVC, using ``enabled`` instead.

Removed
=======

Fixed
=====
- Only redeploy when handling ``kytos/topology.link_up`` if a dynamic EVC isn't active
- Fixed possible EVCs duplication when constant delete requests are sent.
- Improved log when path was not deployed due to TAG availability. Also, in this case, the log was change to error instead of warning.
- Fixed ``node_name`` not showing in the EVC list and EVC details on the web interface.

Deprecated

***********************

Added
=====
- Added a UI button for redeploying an EVC.
- UNI tag_type are now accepted as string.
- Event ``kytos/mef_eline.evcs_loaded`` gets published during NApp setup
- EVCs now listen to ``switch.interface.(link_up|link_down|created|deleted)`` events for activation/deactivation
- Circuits with a vlan range are supported now. The ranges follows ``list[list[int]]`` format and both UNIs vlan should have the same ranges.
- Usage of special vlans ``"untagged"`` and ``"any"`` now send an event to each Interface.
- Added ``UNI_STATE_CHANGE_DELAY`` which configures the time for ``mef_eline`` to wait on link state flaps and update EVCs with last updated event.
- Added support for ``not_ownership`` to dynamic path constraints.
- Added support for ``not_ownership`` on main UI interface.

Changed
=======
- EVCs will try to maintain their current_path on link status changes
- UNIs now will use and free tags from ``Interface.available_tags``.
- UNI tag_type is changed to string from 1, 2 and 3 values to ``"vlan"``, ``"vlan_qinq"`` and ``"mpls"`` respectively.
- Add ``set_vlan`` only if UNI A vlan and UNI z vlan are different.
- Updated ``openapi.yml``, ``Tag`` now can accept ``array`` as ``value``.
- Updated UI interface to support list of ranges of VLANs.
- Improved log for invalid traces by adding ``From EVC(evc_id) named 'evc_name'``
- An inactive and enabled EVC will be redeploy if an attribute from ``attributes_requiring_redeploy`` is updated.
- If a KytosEvent can't be put on ``buffers.app`` during ``setup()``, it'll make the NApp to fail to start
- Disjointedness algorithm now takes into account switches, excepting the UNIs switches. Unwanted switches have the same value as the unwanted links.
- Archived EVCs are not longer kept in memory. They can only be found in the database.

Deprecated
==========
- Deleted emition of ``kytos/.*.link_available_tags`` event. ``kytos/core.interface_tags`` event through Interface takes its place.

General Information
===================
- ``scripts/vlan_type_string.py`` can be used to update the collection ``evcs`` by changing ``tag_type`` from integer to string.
- ``scripts/redeploy_evpls_same_vlans.py`` can be used to redeploy symmetric (same UNI vlans) EVPLs in batch.

Fixed
=====
- required at least one circuit_id on ``POST v2/evc/metadata``
- fixed race condition in ``failover_path`` when handling simultaneous Link Down events leading to inconsistencies on some EVC
- fixed sdntrace_cp check_trace ``current_path`` comparison with the expected UNI order
- fixed ``DynamicPathManager.get_paths`` return value when ``pathfinder`` returns a request error
- ``failover_path`` will get removed if it exists during a redeploy

[2023.1.0] - 2023-06-27
***********************

Added
=====
- Added more content keys ``evc_id, name, metadata, active, enabled, uni_a, uni_z`` to events from ``mef_eline``
- Added ``uni_a`` and ``uni_z`` to ``attributes_requiring_redeploy``
- Added ``metadata`` to EVC schema
- Allow the creation of ``any`` and ``untagged`` EVC.
- Added API request ``POST /v2/evc/metadata`` to add metadata to EVCs
- Added API request ``DELETE /v2/evc/metadata/<key>`` to delete metadata from EVCs
- Subscribed to new event ``kytos/of_multi_table.enable_table`` as well as publishing ``kytos/mef_eline.enable_table`` required to set a different ``table_id`` to flows.
- Added ``settings.TABLE_GROUP_ALLOWED`` set containning the allowed table groups, for now ``'evpl', 'epl'`` are supported.
- Added ui support for primary and secondary constraints
- Added ``QUEUE_ID`` to ``settings.py`` to be the default value for EVCs ``"queue_id"``
- Exposed default ``SPF_ATTRIBUTE`` on settings.py, the default value is still `"hop"`. This value will be parametrized whenever ``primary_constraints.spf_attribute`` or ``secondary_constraints.spf_attribute`` isn't set

Changed
=======
- Moved request circuit ``k-button`` out of k-accordion-item since it's mandatory
- The traces being check rely on ``type``: ``last`` to be considered valid.
- ``dl_vlan`` value is mapped to an integer in range [1, 4095] for the ``/traces`` requests to ``sdntrace_cp``
- Augmented ``GET /v2/evc/`` to accept parameters ``metadata.key=item``
- Upgraded ``openapi-core`` to ``0.16.6`` from ``0.14.5``.
- Changed ``openapi.yml`` to be used as validation spec for request related methods ``updated()``, ``create_schedule()`` and ``update_schedule()``.
- ``mef_eline`` now supports table group settings from ``of_multi_table``
- Changed increasing amount of flows being sent, now it is fixed. Amount can be changed on ``settings.BATCH_SIZE``
- Changed UI constraints default values to pass the spec validation
- Changed intra-switch EVC with a disabled switch or interface is not longer allowed to be created
- Adapted ``mef_eline`` to ordered endpoints in a link. Endpoints for flow creation are compared with switch ids to overcome ordered endpoint.
- EVCs UNI will be checked for disabled interfaces so the EVC is disabled as well.
- ``primary_constraints.spf_attribute`` and ``secondary_constraints.spf_attribute`` will only be set in the database if they've been set in the request.
- Changed UI spf_attribute to allow it to be ``default``, meaning an unset value

General Information
===================
- ``./scripts/002_unset_spf_attribute.py`` is a script to unset both ``primary_constraints.spf_attribute`` and ``secondary_constraints.spf_attribute``. On version 2022.3, this value was explicitly set, so you can use this script to unset this value if you want that ``spf_attribute`` follows the default ``settings.SPF_ATTRIBUTE`` value.
- ``@rest`` endpoints are now run by ``starlette/uvicorn`` instead of ``flask/werkzeug``.
- Replaced ``@validate`` with ``@validate_openapi`` from kytos core

  which improves significantly the convergence performance when facing link down
- Refactored Link Down handler to dispatch Kytos Events to handle traditional
  EVCs (EVCs that are not eligible for failover) more efficiently.

Changed
