All notable changes to the MEF_ELine NApp will be documented in this file.

[Unreleased]
************

Added
=====
- Added ``service_level`` EVC attribute to set the service network convergence level, the higher the better
- EVCs with higher service level priority will be handled first during network convergence, including when running ``sdntrace_cp`` consistency checks.
- Added support for constrained paths for primary dynamic paths and failover paths, ``primary_constraints`` and ``secondary_constraints`` can be set via API.
- Added ``service_level`` UI component on ``k-toolbar`` and made it editable.
- Added ``sb_priority`` UI component on ``k-toolbar``.
- Added ``queue_id`` UI component on ``k-toolbar``.
- Documented ``GET /v2/evc?archived`` query arg on openapi.yml

Changed
=======
- ``priority`` has been renamed to ``sb_priority`` (southbound priority), ``./scripts/001_rename_priority.py`` can be used to update EVC documents accordingly
- ``GET /v2/evc?archived=true`` will only return archived EVCs
- k-toolbar UI component won't expose UNI tag type anymore, if a tag value is set, it'll assume it's tag type vlan.

Removed
=======
- ``priority`` is no longer supported in the API spec

Fixed
=====
- Removed the failover path after removing flows
- Removed failover flows when an EVC gets deleted
- Validated ``queue_id`` on ``POST /v2/evc``
- Fixed found but unloaded message log attempt for archived EVCs

[2022.2.0] - 2022-08-12
***********************

Added
=====

- Reintroduced Q-in-Q when creating the flows for an EVC.
- Optimize list of circuits filters
- Migrated persistency from kytos/storehouse to MongoDB (integration with pymongo)
- ELineController and DB models
- Retries to handle database ``AutoReconnect`` exception.
- ``DynamicPathManager.get_disjoint_paths`` to calculates the maximum disjoint
  paths from a given "unwanted_path" (typically the currently in use path) using
  the approach described in blueprint EP029
- Fully dynamic EVCs can now benefit from Failover Paths (``failover_path``),
  which improves significantly the convergence performance when facing link down
- Refactored Link Down handler to dispatch Kytos Events to handle traditional
  EVCs (EVCs that are not eligible for failover) more efficiently.

Changed
=======

- ``DynamicPathManager.get_paths`` to also supports ``max_paths`` parameter and
  then request more paths from pathfinder (default to 2, which is also the
  default on pathfinder)

General Information
===================
- ``scripts/storehouse_to_mongo.py`` can be used to migrate data from storehouse to MongoDB

- Added endpoint to allow update circuit informations.

  - When primary_path and backup_path goes down or under_maintenance and
    `dynamic_backup_path` is setted as True a dynamic path is choosed using the
    PathFinder NApp when the primary and backup path is both down or not
    setted.
  - When the primary_path is down and backup_path exists and is UP the circuit
    will change from primary_path to backup_path.
  - When the primary_path change from DOWN to UP the circuits will change to
    the primary_path.

Thanks @ajoaoff for recommends this library.

of CircuitScheduler, this instances will have the information about the
scheduler informations.
